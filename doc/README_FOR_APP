== RailsDB

{RailsDB}[http://railsdb.org/] is a web application written in Ruby using the Ruby on Rails web framework to provide a generic interface to popular databases such as SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Oracle.

=== Prerequisites and Assumptions

- {Ruby}[http://www.ruby-lang.org/] and {Ruby on Rails}[http://rubyonrails.com/] are required to run RailsDB. Please visit those sites for installation instructions.
- Rails depends on a stable version of Ruby, {version 1.8.7 is being recommended for Rails 2.1.0}[http://rubyonrails.com/down] currently.
- RailsDB may at any time depend on a specific version of Rails. Using something close to that version will usually work as well.  Check or update the RAILS_GEM_VERSION in config/environment.db as required.

- You can install a specific version of Rails using gem, for example:

    gem install rails -v=2.1.0

- RailsDB is installed using rake commands.  Install rake:

    gem install rake

- Using RailsDB with SQLite requires the sqlite3-ruby gem.

    gem install sqlite3-ruby

- Using RailsDB with MySQL requires the mysql gem.

    gem install mysql

    or

    gem install mysql -- --with-mysql-dir=/usr/local/mysql

- Using RailsDB with PostgreSQL requires the postgres gem.

    gem install postgres

- Using RailsDB with Oracle requires the oracle gem.

    gem install activerecord-oracle-adapter

- You will also need to install individual Ruby database drivers as required.

- RailsDB requires the paginator gem.

    gem install paginator

- Information about Ruby Gems and how to install new Gems can be found {here}[http://rubygems.org/].

=== Install RailsDB

- Assuming a "development" environment (adjust for "production"), migrate the local SQLite database:

    RAILS_ENV=development rake db:migrate

- If something goes wrong or you need to try again you can undo the migration back to the beginning:

    RAILS_ENV=development rake db:migrate VERSION=0

    or

    rm -f db/development.sqlite3

- If you do not wish to use SQLite, then have a look at config/database.yml and setup another option.

- Start server:

    script/server

- Browse to http://localhost:3000

- Login with:

    u: railsdb
    p: changeme

=== Finally..

Run "rake doc:app" to regenerate API documentation for the models, controllers, helpers, and libraries.  Then visit railsdb/doc/app/index.html in your browser.

Run "rake test:coverage" to execute the test suite.  Then visit: http://localhost:3000/coverage
