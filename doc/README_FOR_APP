== RailsDB

{RailsDB}[http://railsdb.org/] is a web application written in Ruby using the Ruby on Rails web framework to provide a generic interface to popular open source databases such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite.

=== Prerequisites and Assumptions

- {Ruby}[http://www.ruby-lang.org/] and {Ruby on Rails}[http://rubyonrails.com/] are required to run RailsDB.  Please visit those sites for installation instructions.
- Rails depends on a stable version of Ruby, {version 1.8.6 is being recommended}[http://rubyonrails.com/down] currently.
- RailsDB may at any time depend on a specific version of Rails. Using something close to that version will usually work as well.  Check or update the RAILS_GEM_VERSION in config/environment.db as required.

- You can install a specific version of Rails using gem, for example:

    gem install rails -v=2.0.2

- RailsDB is installed using rake commands.  Install rake:

    gem install rake

- Using RailsDB with SQLite requires the sqlite3-ruby gem.

    gem install sqlite3-ruby

- Using RailsDB with MySQL requires the mysql gem.

    gem install mysql
    
    or
    
    gem install mysql -- --with-mysql-dir=/usr/local/mysql

- Using RailsDB with PostgreSQL requires the postgres gem.

    gem install postgres
    
- RailsDB requires the paginator gem.

    gem install paginator

- Information about Ruby Gems and how to install new Gems can be found {here}[http://rubygems.org/].

=== Install RailsDB

- Assuming a "development" environment (adjust for "production"), migrate the local SQLite database:

    RAILS_ENV=development rake db:migrate

- If something goes wrong or you need to try again you can undo the migration back to the beginning:
    
    RAILS_ENV=development rake db:migrate VERSION=0
    
- If you do not wish to use SQLite, then have a look at config/database.yml and setup another option.
    
- Start server:

    script/server

- Browse to http://localhost:3000

- Login with:

    u: railsdb
    p: changeme

=== Finally..

Run "rake doc:app" to regenerate API documentation for the models, controllers, helpers, and libraries.
